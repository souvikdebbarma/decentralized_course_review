## Vision

The Find application aims to provide an immutable and transparent platform for students to review courses. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures that reviews are credible and tamper-proof. Students can earn tokens as a reward for contributing honest feedback, fostering a community-driven approach to course evaluation.
